# Medical-diagnosis-using-AI
This project is an AI-powered medical diagnosis system designed to predict multiple diseases at an early stage. 
It uses machine learning models trained on real-world healthcare datasets to detect conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, lung cancer, and hypothyroidism. 
The application provides a simple and interactive web interface where users can enter medical parameters and instantly receive prediction results.
By combining multiple trained models into a single platform, the system improves accessibility to preliminary health assessment.
This project highlights the effective use of artificial intelligence in healthcare to enhance diagnostic accuracy, decision-making, and overall efficiency.
